lojban.peg and morph_header.peg are from [1] (specifically, the "by-hand
modified PEG grammar" and "morphology header file" links, respectively), while
morpho.peg is from [2].  Apparently, when camxes is built, the three files are
all processed & merged together into a single Rats! file.

peg.txt is from the camxes source directory at [3]; I'm not entirely clear on
how it relates to everything else, but it looks useful.
