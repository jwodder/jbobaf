Decisions that must or can be made regarding underspecified and variant rules
of Lojban:
 - Morphology:
  - whether any or all of these rules apply to {cmavo}, {cmene}, and/or
    {fu'ivla}
  - Vowels:
   - whether rising diphthongs containing 'y' are eligible for emphasis and/or
     count towards a {brivla}'s polysyllabicity requirement
   - whether rising diphthongs are allowed immediately after a consonant
   - whether triphthongs are allowed
   - whether two adjacent vowels/diphthongs are allowed without an intervening
     consonant or apostrophe
    - whether this is allowed without an intervening comma
    - whether such a division should be assumed for any adjacent vowels
      otherwise in the same syllable that do not form a valid vowel sequence
      (and, if so, how exactly to break them up)
   - whether adjacent vowels with differing stress markings (i.e., one
     uppercase & the other lowercase or one accented & the other not) should be
     split into separate syllables
  - Consonant clusters:
   - whether clusters of three or more consonants in a row are allowed and, if
     so, what rules they must obey
    - Under a strict reading of the CLL, only {lujvo} have restrictions on
      lengthy consonant clusters; {fu'ivla} & {cmene} can contain any sequence
      of consonants in which each pair is valid (except for consonant clusters
      at the beginning of a {fu'ivla}, for which every consonant pair must be
      an initial pair).
   - whether the prohibition against "ndj", "ndz", "ntc", & "nts" applies to
     {fu'ivla} and/or {cmene}
   - whether {cmene} may begin with non-initial consonant pairs
  - Punctuation:
   - whether an apostrophe can occur on either side of a diphthong (and for
     which kinds of diphthongs)
   - whether apostrophes may separate three or more vocalic nuclei in a row
   - whether (non-superfluous) commas may appear between adjacent consonants
   - whether a non-superfluous comma may appear between a consonant & a vowel
   - whether mandatory periods may be formally omitted when adjacent to
     whitespace
  - whether the dotside is in effect
  - whether a {cmene} may lack both vowels & syllabic consonants
   - If they cannot, and assuming that the dotside is not in effect, is "{la
     lan.}" valid?
  - whether {cmene} may contain more than one capitalized/emphasized syllable
  - whether a {cmene} can be emphasized on a syllabic consonant or 'y'
  - whether {rafsi} can contain syllables with an empty onset (i.e., beginning
    with a comma)
  - whether {rafsi} can be of the form C[iu]V
  - whether or not {fu'ivla} may contain 'y'
   - relatedly, whether {rafsi fu'ivla} are in effect
  - whether {brivla} should obey the five-letter rule or a {ma'osmi} rule
  - whether uppercase consonants have any significance
  - whether uppercase Y's have any significance or are to be treated as
    erroneous
 - Magic words:
  - which magic words take effect inside LOhU ... LEhU quotes
  - whether an erasure can re-open a ZO, ZOI, or error quote
  - which magic words are nullified by being on the left and/or right of a ZEI
  - precedences of magic words
  - whether to recognize LAhOI
  - how many SIs are required to erase an empty or non-empty quoted construct
  - how "{.y.}" interacts with magic words
 - Syntax:
  - whether to use anything listed at
    <http://www.lojban.org/tiki/zasni+gerna+cenba+vreji>
   - whether to use xorxes' proposed change to the grammar of tags:
     <http://www.lojban.org/tiki/Internal+grammar+of+tags>
   - whether to allow free modifiers wherever indicators are allowed
   - whether to merge the syntactic categories of CMEVLA and BRIVLA
  - whether to require all descriptor {sumti} followed by a non-logical
    connective to be explicitly terminated
  - whether to allow LE KU and LA KU
