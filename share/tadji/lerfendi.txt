A generalized form of the Lojban word-splitting algorithm, as I understand it:
 - Let FENDI be a function (described below) that maps a string of characters
   containing neither spaces nor periods to a string of Lojban {valsi}.
 - Let CMAVO, CMEVLA, and BRIVLA be functions that convert a string of
   characters into the corresponding Lojban {cmavo}, {cmevla}, or {brivla},
   respectively, assuming total morphological validity of the input.  If their
   input is invalid, either for the given type of {valsi} or by the more
   general rules of Lojban morphology, the result is undefined.
 - Let ++ be an operator that concatenates strings.
 - Given a string Λ of Lojban text, the Lojban words contained in it are the
   concatenated results of applying FENDI to each nonempty maximal substring of
   non-space, non-period characters in Λ in order of appearance, with the
   following exceptions:
  - Should FENDI return a {valsi} string containing a {cmavo} of {selma'o} ZOI,
    let δ be the {valsi} returned immediately after this {cmavo}; if δ does not
    occur at the end of a single {valsi} string returned by a call to FENDI,
    the text is invalid.  Let ζ be the string of all characters in Λ after the
    string corresponding to δ, up to but not including the next occurrence of a
    string representation of δ preceded by spaces and/or periods.  (If the ZOI
    occurs at the end of Λ, or if there is no subsequent occurrence of δ, the
    text is invalid.)  The contents of ζ shall not be examined for Lojban
    words, and the tokenization of Λ shall otherwise continue after ζ as
    before.
  - Should FENDI return a {valsi} string containing a {cmavo} of {selma'o}
    FAhO, all {valsi} occurring after it in Λ, including any & all occurrences
    of errors or invalid text, are to be ignored.
  - [[TO DO: Add in how ZOI & FAhO are affected by the other magic words.]]
 - A syllable whose nucleus is neither a 'y' nor a syllabic consonant is
   hereafter referred to as an "accentable syllable."
 - A maximal-length string of the form /^C?[Vy]+([',][Vy]+)*$/ is hereafter
   referred to as a "{ma'osmi}."
 - Techniques for attempting to handle or recover from invalid strings are
   outside the scope of this algorithm.
 - FENDI(γ) is defined by the following cases:
  0. FENDI(ε) := ε
  1. If γ contains a violation of the general morphological rules of Lojban
     (e.g., it contains a character not in the Lojban alphabet, an invalid
     consonant pair/triple/vowel sequence, or an apostrophe not between two
     vowels), then γ is invalid.
  2. If the last character in γ is a consonant:
   a. If the dotside is not in effect and γ contains one or more occurrences of
      the strings "la", "lai", "la'i", or "doi" that are neither preceded by a
      consonant nor followed by an apostrophe or vowel, then FENDI(γ) :=
      FENDI(α) ++ CMEVLA(ω), where α is the substring before the last such
      string in γ and ω is the remaining substring in γ.
   b. Otherwise, FENDI(γ) := CMEVLA(γ).
  3. If the last character in γ is a 'y', then FENDI(γ) := FENDI(α) ++
     CMAVO(ω), where ω is the {ma'osmi} at the end of γ and α is the substring
     of γ preceding ω.  (If α ends with a consonant, γ is invalid.)
  4. If γ contains two or more adjacent consonants, each possibly separated by
     a single 'y' (hereafter referred to as a "consonant cluster"):
   a. If the portion of γ starting at the beginning of the last accentable
      syllable before the consonant cluster, or at the consonant cluster itself
      if there are no accentable syllables before it, contains an accentable
      syllable with a capitalized or accented nucleus and followed (not
      necessarily immediately) by two or more accentable syllables (the first
      of which is hereafter called the "ultima"; if this syllable is terminated
      by an apostrophe or non-initial consonant cluster, γ is invalid), then
      let α be the substring of γ up to and including the end of the ultima,
      and let ω be the substring of γ after the ultima.  Otherwise, let α equal
      γ and let ω be the empty string (ε).
    i.  If α contains two or more accentable syllables with capitalized or
	accented nuclei, γ is invalid.
    ii. Note that, due to steps 2 and 3, it is impossible at this point for the
	ultima to be followed by a non-empty non-punctuation string that does
	not contain an accentable syllable.
   b. Let the "body" consist of the contents of α from the beginning of the
      first consonant cluster onwards.  If all of the following conditions
      hold:
    i.   The consonant cluster at the beginning of the body consists entirely
	 of initial (overlapping, if more than one) consonant pairs.
    ii.  The body has more than one accentable syllable.
    iii. Prepending a string of the form CV to the body cannot result in a
	 morphologically valid {lujvo}.
      then let β be the body and let β′ be true.  Otherwise, if the portion of
      α before the body ends with a {ma'osmi} that, when encompassing as many
      characters as possible, contains no more than three non-punctuation,
      non-Y characters, then let β be this {ma'osmi} prepended to the body and
      let β′ be true.  Otherwise, let β be the body and let β′ be false.  For
      all cases, let δ be the portion of α not in β.
   c. FENDI(γ) := FENDI(δ) ++ χ ++ FENDI(ω), where χ is defined as follows:
    i.   If β′ is true and β is a valid {brivla}, χ := BRIVLA(β).
    ii.  Otherwise, if the first consonant cluster in β has a 'y' between its
	 first two consonants, χ := FENDI(φ) ++ FENDI(ψ), where φ is the
	 portion of β up to & including this 'y' and ψ is the remaining portion
	 of β.
    iii. Otherwise, β is invalid.
  5. Otherwise, FENDI(γ) is the string formed by applying CMAVO to each maximal
     non-overlapping {ma'osmi} substring of γ, starting from the beginning of
     γ.
 - Observation: In a non-{cmene} string containing a consonant cluster, all
   {ma'osmi} before the one immediately before the cluster will always be
   converted into {cmavo}.
