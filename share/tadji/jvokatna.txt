How to split a {lujvo} into its component {rafsi} and check it for validity:
 0. If the {lujvo} contains any invalid consonant pairs, invalid consonant
    triples, or other features prohibited by general Lojban morphology, it is
    invalid.
 1. Let ω be the string formed from the last three letters of the {lujvo},
    including but not counting inner apostrophes.
  a. If ω is of the form CVV, it forms a single {rafsi}.
  b. If ω is of the form VCV, it must be preceded by an initial consonant pair,
     together with which it forms a CCVCV {rafsi}.
  c. If ω is of the form C/CV where C/C is not an initial consonant pair, it
     must be preceded by a string of the form CV, together with which it forms
     a CVC/CV {rafsi}.
  d. If ω is of the form CCV, let ψ be the portion of the {lujvo} preceding it,
     not including any & all consecutive strings of the form CCV immediately
     preceding ω.  If ψ ends with a string of the form CV, then ω must be
     immediately preceded by a CV string, together with which it forms a CVCCV
     {rafsi}; otherwise, ω is a CCV {rafsi}, and all CCV strings in the {lujvo}
     that are in neither ψ nor ω are also CCV {rafsi}.
  e. Otherwise, the {lujvo} is invalid.
 2. While there remains a non-empty substring of the {lujvo} that has not yet
    been split into {rafsi}:
  a. If the remaining substring is of the form CVV[rn]?, then if neither or
     both of the below conditions hold, the CVV portion forms a {rafsi}.  If
     exactly one of the below conditions holds, the {lujvo} is invalid.
   i.  If either more than one {rafsi} has been identified or else exactly one
       {rafsi}, which is not of the form CCV, has been identified, then the
       remaining substring must end with a consonant that is an 'r', unless the
       first letter after the substring is an 'r', in which case the substring
       must end with an 'n'.
   ii. Otherwise, the substring may not end with a consonant.
  b. If the remaining substring ends with a string of the form CVCy (hereafter
     referred to as φ), then if all of the following conditions hold:
   i.   φ is immediately preceded by a consonant which forms an initial
	consonant pair with the first letter of φ.
   ii.  φ is immediately preceded by zero or more consecutive (non-hyphenated)
	strings of the form CVC.
   iii. All consonant pairs existing in the concatenation of the strings in
	(ii) are initial consonant pairs.
   iv.  The strings in (ii) are immediately preceded by a consonant which forms
	an initial consonant pair with the consonant immediately after it.
     then φ, together with the consonant preceding it, forms a CCVCy {rafsi}.
     Otherwise, φ (minus the 'y', which is discarded) is a CVC {rafsi}.  In the
     latter case, if the absense of the 'y' would not cause an invalid
     consonant pair or triple to be present in the {lujvo}, denote the location
     of the 'y' by τ; if a value has already been assigned to τ during the
     execution of this algorithm, or if the two letterals on either side of the
     'y' do not form an initial consonant pair, the {lujvo} is invalid.
  c. If the remaining substring ends with a string of the form CCV, CVV, CVC,
     or CVC/Cy, this terminal string forms a {rafsi}.
  d. Otherwise, the {lujvo} is invalid.
 3. If only one {rafsi} has been identified in the {lujvo}, it is invalid.
 4. If when the hyphen at location τ (if any) is ignored, one of the following
    is true:
  a. The {lujvo} consists of one or more CVC {rafsi} followed by a CVCCV
     {rafsi}, there are no hyphens in the {lujvo}, and all consonant pairs in
     the {lujvo} are initial consonant pairs.
  b. The {lujvo} consists of two or more non-hyphenated CVC {rafsi} followed by
     a 'y' hyphen and an arbitrary string of {rafsi}, and all consonant pairs
     within the concatenated string of CVC {rafsi} are initial.
    then τ must have had a value assigned to it during the execution of step 2,
    and the hyphen at τ is located immediately after the first {rafsi} in the
    {lujvo}.  Otherwise, a value must not have been assigned to τ.
