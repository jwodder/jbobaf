Morphological rules which may or may not be in effect:
 - whether any or all of these rules apply to {cmavo}, {cmene}, and/or
   {fu'ivla}
 - Diphthongs & triphthongs:
  - whether rising diphthongs containing 'y' are eligible for emphasis
  - whether rising diphthongs are allowed immediately after a consonant
  - whether triphthongs are allowed
 - Consonant clusters:
  - whether clusters of three or more consonants in a row are allowed and, if
    so, what rules they must obey
   - Under a strict reading of the CLL, only {lujvo} have restrictions on
     lengthy consonant clusters; {fu'ivla} & {cmene} can contain any sequence of
     consonants in which each pair is valid (except for consonant clusters at
     the beginning of a {fu'ivla}, for which every consonant pair must be an
     initial pair).
  - whether the prohibition against "ndj", "ndz", "ntc", & "nts" applies to
    {fu'ivla} and/or {cmene}
  - whether {cmene} may begin with non-initial consonant pairs
 - Punctuation:
  - whether an apostrophe can occur on either side of a diphthong (and for
    which kinds of diphthongs)
  - whether three or more vowels/diphthongs in a row may be separated by
    apostrophes
  - whether (non-superfluous) commas may appear between adjacent consonants
  - whether a non-superfluous comma may appear between a consonant & a vowel
  - the dotside
  - whether mandatory periods may be formally omitted when adjacent to
    whitespace
 - whether two adjacent vowels/diphthongs are allowed without an intervening
   consonant or apostrophe
  - whether this is allowed without an intervening comma
  - whether such a division should be assumed for any adjacent vowels otherwise
    in the same syllable that do not form a valid diphthong
 - whether a {cmene} may lack both vowels & syllabic consonants
  - If they cannot, and assuming that the dotside is not in effect, is "{la
    lan.}" valid?
 - whether {cmene} may contain more than one capitalized/emphasized syllable
 - whether a {cmene} can be emphasized on a syllabic consonant or 'y'?
 - whether {rafsi} can contain syllables with an empty onset (i.e., beginning
   with a comma)
 - whether {rafsi} can be of the form C[iu]V
 - whether or not {fu'ivla} may contain 'y'
  - relatedly, whether {rafsi fu'ivla} are in effect
 - whether rising diphthongs containing 'y' count towards a {brivla}'s
   polysyllabicity requirement
 - whether {brivla} should obey the five-letter rule or a {ma'osmi} rule
 - Magic words:
  - which magic words take effect inside LOhU ... LEhU quotes
  - whether an erasure can re-open a ZO, ZOI, or error quote
  - which magic words are nullified by being on the left and/or right of a ZEI
  - precedences of magic words
  - whether to recognize LAhOI

Grammatical rules which may or may not be in effect:
 - xorxes' proposed change to the grammar of tags:
   <http://www.lojban.org/tiki/Internal+grammar+of+tags>
 - requiring explicitly terminating a {sumti} followed by a non-logical
   connective
