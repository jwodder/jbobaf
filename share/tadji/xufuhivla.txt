A string φ is a valid Lojban {fu'ivla} if & only if it satisfies all of the
following conditions:
 - φ is non-empty.
 - φ contains no invalid consonant pairs, invalid vowel sequences, non-Lojbanic
   characters, or other character sequences globally prohibited by the more
   general rules of Lojban morphology.
 - Any & all spaces and periods occur at the beginning or end of φ; all such
   characters are to be ignored for the remainder of these tests.
 - The letteral 'y' (case insensitive) does not appear in φ.
 - The last letteral in φ is a Lojban vowel (excluding 'y').
 - φ has the form of neither a {gismu} nor a {lujvo}.
 - If φ begins with a consonant, then prefixing a string of the form CV to it
   cannot result in a morphologically valid {lujvo}.
 - If such a rule is in effect, φ does not contain any of the strings "ndj",
   "ndz", "ntc", & "nts" (case insensitive).
 - φ contains two or more syllables whose nuclei are not syllabic consonants.
 - φ contains a substring consisting of two or more adjacent consonants; denote
   the first such substring by χ and the substring after it by ψ.
 - If every pair of adjacent consonants in χ is an initial consonant pair, ψ
   contains more than one syllable whose nucleus is not a syllabic consonant,
   and prepending a string of the form CV to the concatenation of χ and ψ
   cannot result in a morphologically valid {lujvo}, then χ is at the beginning
   of φ; otherwise, the substring of φ preceding χ has the form of a {cmavo}
   and contains no more than three non-apostrophe characters.
 - If information on emphasis is present, then the penultimate syllable in φ
   whose nucleus is not a syllabic consonant is the only syllable to bear
   primary emphasis.
