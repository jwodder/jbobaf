{ko jdika loni lo selpa'a be do cu banli}

This is an assortment of code in several different programming languages for
doing various things (not always the same ones) to or with text written in the
artificial language Lojban <http://www.lojban.org>.  Don't expect any of it to
work right or at all.  Be happy if it even compiles.  If you want something
stable, see what little there is that's been tagged or is otherwise listed
under "Downloads."  If that's not enough for you, fork it and start coding.

Jbobaf ("Lojbanic bundle") was formerly known as Jboval, and before that as
Vlasisku.  The project's growing lack of focus on any particular aspect of
Lojban has now been embraced, and its goal is to do anything with Lojban that I
can code, ideally with equal support in C, Perl, Haskell, et (fortasse) alii.
We'll see how that works out.
