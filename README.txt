{ko jdika loni lo selpa'a be do cu banli}

Jbobaf ("Lojbanic bundle," formerly known as Jboval and before that as
Vlasisku) is an assortment of code in several different programming languages
for doing various things (not always the same ones) to or with text written in
the artificial language Lojban <http://www.lojban.org>.  Don't expect any of it
to work right or at all.  Be happy if it even compiles.  If you want something
stable, see what little there is that's been tagged or is listed under
"Downloads" on GitHub.  If you want more, feel free to fork it and start
coding.

Due to growing lack of focus on any particular aspect of Lojban, the project's
current "goal" is to do anything with the language that I can code, ideally
(for coding exercise purposes) with equal support in C/C++, Perl, Haskell, et
(fortasse) alii.  We'll see how well that works out.
