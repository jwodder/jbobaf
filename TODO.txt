- Problems with the current version of the word-splitting algorithm:
 - When Y's are allowed in {fu'ivla}, how should something like "acy'ygre",
   "Ã¡cy'ygrelo", or "cacy'ygre" be split?
 - How should something like "CUGRUsi" be split?
- Consider converting the C implementation to C++ so that I have to deal with
  data structures and memory management less
