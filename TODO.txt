- Problems with the current version of the word-splitting algorithm:
 - When Y's are allowed in {fu'ivla}, how should something like "acy'ygre",
   "Ã¡cy'ygrelo", or "cacy'ygre" be split?
 - How should something like "CUGRUsi" be split?
- Consider converting the C implementation to C++ so that I don't have to
  manually deal with data structures, memory management, and exception handling
