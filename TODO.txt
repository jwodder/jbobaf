- Make sure everything is in line with the "BPFK Section: Formal Morphology"
  page of the tiki
- Problems with the current version of the word-splitting algorithm:
 - When Y's are allowed in {fu'ivla}, how should something like "acy'ygre",
   "Ã¡cy'ygrelo", or "cacy'ygre" be split?
 - How should something like "CUGRUsi" be split?
- Consider converting the C implementation to C++ so that I don't have to
  manually deal with data structures, memory management, and exception handling
- Are we calling {lujvo cmevla} "{jvocme}" now?  If so, some minor edits need
  to be made.
