- Add a function for joining {rafsi} into {lujvo}
- Make jvokatna able to split {lujvo cmene}
- Add a function for recognizing type-3 {fu'ivla} and splitting them into
  {rafsi} & non-{rafsi}
- Add & implement Jvacux options for:
 - LAhOI ("{la'oi}" and "{zo'oi}"?)
 - allowing commas between consonants
 - allowing commas between a consonant and a vowel
 - prohibiting commas between vowels
 - prohibiting commas in {fu'ivla} and {cmevla}
 - restricting consonant clusters in {fu'ivla} and {cmevla} (separate options)
   to have all consonant pairs after the first be initial
 - prohibiting rising diphthongs after a consonant (with an option for only
   prohibiting/allowing them in {cmavo}?)
 - prohibiting rising diphthongs in {fu'ivla}
 - prohibiting {cmevla} that begin with non-initial consonant pairs
 - allowing {rafsi} of the form C[iu]V?
 - allowing {rafsi} containing Y's?
 - allowing {rafsi} containing syllables with empty onsets? (e.g., "ka,e")

 - allowing a word break at a comma that is after an ultima or non-dotside
   "la", before a {ma'osmi} at the head of a {brivla}, or between two {ma'osmi}
   in a {cmavo} string when No_commas_in_cmavo is in effect
 - Ignore_bad_ZOI_delims - causes a ZOI followed by a non-word string to
   (effectively) only quote that string
 - treating an opening ZOI delimiter not followed by a space or period as
   invalid
 - converting uppercase letters to {lerfu} words
 - using the alternative rapprochement orthography (converted by fadgau to the
   canonical orthography)
- Write a CGI frontend to lerfendi?
- Add a function for determining the {vlalei} of a word without having to make
  it into a Valsi object?
- Should the isV* functions support accented vowels?
- When Translate_digits (or a different option?) is in effect, fadgau should
  perform the following conversions:
 - 'π' to "pai"
 - '∞' to "ci'i"
 - '/' to "fi'u"
 - '%' to "ce'i"
 - in a numeric sequence - ',' to "ki'o"
 - in a numeric sequence - '.' to "pi"
 - in a numeric sequence - ':' and ';' to "pi'e"
 - before a number - '-' to "ni'u"?
 - before a number - '+' to "ma'u"?
