 - Make fendi.hs automated with comparisons against the correct answers
- Add Haddock documentation for all of the exported functions, values, & types
- Rethink how the Valsi type is structured & used
 - Deal with {lujma'o} somehow
- Make toCmevla handle emphasis by:
 - Converting all letters to lowercase when the stress is normal
 - Uppercasing everything in the nucleus of an abnormally-stressed {cmevla}

- Should lerfendi split "yyyy" into four separate "y"s?
- Consider making Jvacux' use a State monad (in place of the Identity) to track
  the Flezvalei

- Add a function for joining {rafsi} into {lujvo}
- Make jvokatna able to split {lujvo cmene}
- Add a function for recognizing type-3 {fu'ivla} and splitting them into
  {rafsi} & non-{rafsi}
- Add & implement Jvacux options for:
 - LAhOI ("{la'oi}" and "{zo'oi}"?)
 - allowing commas between consonants
 - allowing commas between a consonant and a vowel
 - prohibiting commas between vowels
 - prohibiting commas in {fu'ivla} and {cmevla}
 - restricting consonant clusters in {fu'ivla} and {cmevla} (separate options)
   to have all consonant pairs after the first be initial
 - prohibiting rising diphthongs after a consonant (with an option for only
   prohibiting/allowing them in {cmavo}?)
 - prohibiting rising diphthongs in {fu'ivla}?
 - prohibiting {cmevla} that begin with non-initial consonant pairs
 - allowing {rafsi} of the form C[iu]V?
 - allowing {rafsi} containing Y's?

   in a {cmavo} string when No_commas_in_cmavo is in effect
 - Ignore_bad_ZOI_delims - causes a ZOI followed by a non-word string to
   (effectively) only quote that string
 - treating an opening ZOI delimiter not followed by a space or period as
   invalid
 - converting uppercase letters to {lerfu} words
- Write a CGI frontend to lerfendi?
- Add a function for determining the {vlalei} of a word without having to make
  it into a Valsi object?

 - '/' to "fi'u"
 - '%' to "ce'i"
 - in a numeric sequence - ',' to "ki'o"
 - in a numeric sequence - '.' to "pi"
