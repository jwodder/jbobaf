- Make sure that everything complies with (or at least is compatible with)
  everything listed on the "BPFK Section: Formal Morphology" page of the
  tiki!!!
- Test everything to make sure it works as it's intended!
 - Test performing word splitting with variant sets of options
 - Improve the test words in jvokatna01.txt and fendi01.txt (especially by
   making them all semantically valid)
 - Make fendi.hs automated with comparisons against the correct answers
- Add Haddock documentation for all of the exported functions, values, & types
- Deal with {lujma'o} somehow
- Make toCmevla handle emphasis by:
 - Converting all letters to lowercase when the stress is normal
 - Uppercasing everything in the nucleus of an abnormally-stressed {cmevla} (or
   should that be fadgau's job?)
 - Somehow handling {cmevla} with more than one emphasized syllable
- lerfendi needs to split "yyyy" into four separate "y"s
- PROBLEM: When Allow_Y_in_fu'ivla is in effect, how should something like
  "acy'ygre", "ácy'ygrelo", or "cacy'ygre" be handled?
- PROBLEM: How should something like "CUGRUsi" be split up?

NEW FEATURES
- Add functions to Valsi.hs for computing the component {rafsi}, source
  {tanru}, and {lujvo} score for {lujvo} & {lujvo cmene}.
- Add an equivalent to Vlatai.pm's jvozba
- Make jvokatna able to split {lujvo cmene}
- Add a function for recognizing type-3 {fu'ivla} and splitting them into
  {rafsi} & non-{rafsi}
- Add & implement Jvacux options for:
 - LAhOI ("{la'oi}" and "{zo'oi}"?)
 - allowing commas between consonants
 - allowing commas between a consonant and a vowel
 - prohibiting commas between vowels
 - restricting consonant clusters in {fu'ivla} and {cmevla} (separate options)
   to have all consonant pairs after the first be initial
 - prohibiting rising diphthongs after a consonant (with an option for only
   prohibiting/allowing them in {cmavo}?)
 - prohibiting rising diphthongs in {fu'ivla}
 - prohibiting {cmevla} that begin with non-initial consonant pairs
 - allowing {rafsi} of the form C[iu]V?
 - allowing {rafsi} containing Y's?
 - allowing {rafsi} containing syllables with empty onsets? (e.g., "ka,e")
 - replacing the 5-letter rule with a "{ma'osmi} rule"
 - recognizing {fu'ivla rafsi}
 - prohibiting a 'y' within the first consonant cluster of a {fu'ivla}
 - allowing superfluous hyphens in {lujvo}
 - allowing a word break at a comma that occurs (These should be separate
   options):
  - after an ultima
  - after a non-dotside "la" in a {cmevla} chunk
  - before a {ma'osmi} at the head of a {brivla}
  - between two {ma'osmi} in a {cmavo} string when No_commas_in_cmavo is in
    effect (Should this one be on by default?)
  - inside a {cmevla} when No_commas_in_cmevla is in effect
  - inside a {fu'ivla} when No_commas_in_fu'ivla is in effect
 - Ignore_bad_ZOI_delims - causes a ZOI followed by a non-word string to
   (effectively) only quote that string
 - treating an opening ZOI delimiter not followed by a space or period as
   invalid
 - converting uppercase letters to {lerfu} words
 - using the alternative rapprochement orthography (converted by fadgau to the
   canonical orthography)
 - making ZEI only take effect when preceded by a valid ZEI-{seltau}
- Write a CGI frontend to lerfendi?
- Add a function for determining the {vlalei} of a word without having to make
  it into a Valsi object?
- Should the isV* functions support accented vowels?
- When Translate_digits (or a different option?) is in effect, fadgau should
  perform the following conversions:
 - 'π' to "pai"
 - '∞' to "ci'i"
 - '/' to "fi'u"
 - '%' to "ce'i"
 - in a numeric sequence - ',' to "ki'o"
 - in a numeric sequence - '.' to "pi"
 - in a numeric sequence - ':' and ';' to "pi'e"
 - before a number - '-' to "ni'u"?
 - before a number - '+' to "ma'u"?
