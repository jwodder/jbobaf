- Make sure that everything complies with (or at least is compatible with) the
  "BPFK Section: Formal Morphology" and "BPFK Section: PEG Morphology
  Algorithm" pages on the tiki!!!
- Test everything to make sure it works as it's intended!
- Implement the remaining features for fadgau (including support for
  Allow_triphthongs and Split_bad_diphthongs)
- Add Haddock documentation for all of the exported functions, values, & types
- Rethink how the Valsi type is structured & used
- Deal with {lujma'o} somehow
- Improve the test list of {lujvo} & pseudo-{lujvo} in jvokatna.txt
- Make toCmevla handle emphasis by:
 - Converting all letters to lowercase when the stress is normal
 - Uppercasing everything in the nucleus of an abnormally-stressed {cmevla}
 - Somehow handling {cmevla} with more than one emphasized syllable

NEW FEATURES
- Add functions to Valsi.hs for computing the component {rafsi}, source
  {tanru}, and {lujvo} score for {lujvo} & {lujvo cmene}.
- Make jvokatna able to split {lujvo cmene}
- Add a function for joining {rafsi} into {lujvo}
- Add a new Jvacux option Ignore_bad_ZOI_delims that causes a ZOI followed by a
  non-word string to (effectively) only quote that string
- Add a Jvacux option for treating an opening ZOI delimiter not followed by a
  space or period as invalid
- Add a function for recognizing type-3 {fu'ivla} and splitting them into
  {rafsi} & non-{rafsi}
- Add & implement Jvacux options for:
 - LAhOI ("{la'oi}" and "{zo'oi}"?)
 - allowing commas between consonants
 - allowing commas between a consonant and a vowel
 - prohibiting commas between vowels
 - prohibiting commas in {fu'ivla} and {cmevla}
 - restricting consonant clusters in {fu'ivla} and {cmevla} (separate options)
   to have all consonant pairs after the first be initial
 - prohibiting rising diphthongs after a consonant (with an option for only
   prohibiting/allowing them in {cmavo}?)
 - prohibiting rising diphthongs in {fu'ivla}?
 - prohibiting {cmevla} that begin with non-initial consonant pairs
 - allowing {rafsi} of the form C[iu]V?
 - allowing {rafsi} containing Y's?
 - allowing {rafsi} containing syllables with empty onsets? (e.g., "ka,e")
 - replacing the 5-letter rule with a "{ma'osmi} rule"
 - recognizing {fu'ivla rafsi}
 - prohibiting a 'y' within the first consonant cluster of a {fu'ivla}?
- Possibly make Jvacux into an Error monad as well as a Reader so that the user
  can receive information about exactly *why* something (e.g., jvokatna) failed
 - An option could then be added to Jvacux for specifying whether error
   messages should be in English or Lojban.
 - Add in a way for the xu* functions to return a reason why a word is invalid
 - This can be used to replace Maybes for denoting errors in certain functions
   (i.e., fadgau, toValsi et alii).
