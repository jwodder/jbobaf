General:
 - Translate all of the documentation into Lojban
 - Improve the example code at the start of the modules' POD
 - Write a bunch of test programs for every aspect of the modules

sisku.pl:
 - Idea: Instead of taking multiple operands on the command line which are
   searched for separately, make the command-line syntax more like that of
   `test` and allow specification of multiple conditions which must be matched
   in a given combination.  Or not.
 - Add a way to break {lujvo} apart and give the entries for the parts
 - Add options for searching the notes & hints of {valsi}
 - Add an option for searching by {selma'o}

jvozba.pl:
 - Implement {lujvo} formation with "{zei}" for otherwise invalid words (i.e.,
   {cmavo} without {rafsi}, {cmene}, & {fu'ivla})
 - Handle {lujvo} given on the command line
 - Deal with the possibility of {cmene} containing {la}, {lai}, or {doi} being
   generated (at the very least, mention it in the documentation).

Lojban/Valsi.pm:
 - Improve merging of differing {selma'o} attributes in xrejmina()
 - Eventually, implement mutator methods
 - Add a (safe) way for the user to get a Lojban::Valsi as a hash
 - Add a way for cusku() to force calculation of unknown attributes at the
   user's request?
 - Deal with the possibility of cusku() printing out a {lujvo}-like with undef
   {veljvo} elements
 - Add a method for setting the {valsi} to its normalized form?
 - Cache the normalized form like the other calculated attributes?
 - Add a method for converting Valsi objects into entries for the new
   tab-separated vlaste format
 - Add a class method that takes an entry from either list format and
   automatically passes it to the appropriate constructor

Lojban/Vlasisku.pm:
 - Write a function for getting words by both keyword and definition
 - Lojbanize all of the function names (rewrite getValsiByRafsi() to contain
   the term 'selraf'?)
 - Add a getValsiByKlesi() function?
 - Add a getValsiByAny() function that checks all fields for matches?
 - Add a wrapper around grep that checks for matches using a closure?

Lojban/Vlatai.pm:
 - Correctness:
  - Rewrite xulujvo() so that it rejects {lujvo} with superfluous or missing
    hyphens
  - Make the xu{brivla}() functions test for the correct location of emphasis
  - Make &xufuhivla (and &xucmavo/&xulujmaho?) able to handle commas correctly
  - Bring everything in line with the "BPFK Section: Formal Morphology" page of
    the tiki
 - Add a $VV regex?
 - Handle all currently undefined situations
 - Further optimize the C*C regexes
 - Improve &fadgau
  - Make it remove more superfluous commas
  - Make it convert all letters to lowercase, unless the word is a {cmene} with
    irregular emphasis, in which case only the vowels from the emphasized
    syllable should be uppercase
  - Deal with more types of accents?
